- Live analysis of your CPU (*still in development*)

- Analysis of the wifi networks around you and measure the quality of the networks, how far you are from these networks...

- Scan ports that are open on your computer with local address, protocol, process, state.

- A table with the versions of all the languages that are on your computer.

- A table with all the versions of the main software on your computer.

Being a beta phase of the software, to launch it you must enter the command :
